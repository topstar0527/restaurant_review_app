## project description
Please create a website which displays a list of assets (whatever you want, it can be a list of NFTs, a list of books, a list of spoons, â€¦ anything, be creative). 
- Each item must have an image, a title and a description. 
- A user must be able to create, edit or delete an item 
Requirements: 
- You must use a database to store / fetch the items data 
- You must use a server in NodeJS to create an api (or other JS framework) - You must use a JS frontend framework (next, react,...) 
Bonus points: 
- Use Typescript 
- Integrate a wallet connection (Metamask/Polkadot.js extension) 
- Beautiful design / demonstration of your design integration skills 
- Deploy your dapp using serverless providers 
- More features to showcase your motivation 
Make your code public so that we can review it and give us an url to see it (or instructions / readme to run it locally).

## what done?
I have finished all above requirements, add some other functions.

User must be able to create an account and log in. (If a mobile application, this means that more users can use the app from the same phone).

Implement 3 roles with different permission levels
* Regular User: Can rate and leave a comment for a restaurant
* Owner: Can create restaurants and reply to comments about owned restaurants
* Admin: Can edit/delete all users, restaurants, comments, and reviews
    
Reviews should have:
* A 5 star based rating
* Date of the visit
* Comment 
    
When a Regular User logs in, they will see a Restaurant List ordered by Average Rating

When an Owner logs in, they will see a Restaurant List - only the ones owned by them, and the reviews pending reply

Owners can reply to each review once

Restaurants detailed view should have:
* The overall average rating
* The highest rated review
* The lowest rated review
* Last reviews with rate, comment, and reply
    
Restaurant List can be filtered by Rating

## Usage
you have to create owner account to update and delete restaurant infos.
